# Console Control Strings

A library of cross-platform tested terminal/console command strings for
doing things like color and cursor positioning.  This is a subset of both
ansi and vt100.  All control codes included work on both Windows & Unix-like
OSes, except where noted.

## Usage

```js
var consoleControl = require('console-control-strings')

console.log(consoleControl.color('blue','bgRed', 'bold') + 'hi there' + consoleControl.color('reset'))
process.stdout.write(consoleControl.goto(75, 10))
```

## Why Another?

There are tons of libraries similar to this one.  I wanted one that was:

1. Very clear about compatibility goals.
2. Could emit, for instance, a start color code without an end one.
3. Returned strings w/o writing to streams.
4. Was not weighed down
